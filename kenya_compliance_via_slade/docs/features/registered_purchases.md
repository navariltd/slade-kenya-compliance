### Fetching Purchases

<a id="registered_purchases"></a>

Users are able to fetch Sales details registered by other Parties that form the basis for Purchase Documents.

Once the counter-party's sales information (your purchase) is successfully fetched, you can create Items, Suppliers, Purchase Invoices, and Purchase Receits from the details.

**NOTE**: This feature is highly experimental and may result in discrepancies between the information fetched and the generated records, e.g. Tax Details after creating a Purchase Invoice.
