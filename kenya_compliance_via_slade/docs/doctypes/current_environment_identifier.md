### 🌍 Current Environment Identifier

<a id="current_env_id"></a>

The **Current Environment Identifier** doctype is crucial for determining the environment in which your ERPNext instance operates. This setting influences whether communication occurs with the **Sandbox** or **Production** eTims servers provided by KRA.

This is a **Single** doctype with only two possible values:

- **Sandbox**
- **Production**

> **Note**: This option is applied globally to all users of the current ERPNext instance.
